# ZoteroApiSimple

This is a super-simple example for how to use the Zotero API to produce bibliographic listings on a web page.

- Uses https://www.npmjs.com/package/zotero-api-client / https://github.com/tnajdek/zotero-api-client: Install https://github.com/tnajdek/zotero-api-client first
- Then download app.js and run 
`node app.js`

The UI is very basic, and prob. won't make sense unless you know a fair bit about Zotero. Note that the listings are picked up by the Zotero connector, due to embedded COinS.
